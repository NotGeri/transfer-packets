# transfer-packets

This is a POC on how you can transfer players to different servers in Minecraft snapshot 24w03a.
It will be a fun thing for modern networks to play around with.

It's also a hilarious opportunity for malware creators to silently steal new players by redirecting them to their own
servers. :D
